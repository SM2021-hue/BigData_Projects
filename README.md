# BigData_Projects
Architecture: 1) Amazon EC2 acts as website backend generating server logs. 2) Kinesis Datastreams reads the server logs in real time and pushes it to Kinesis Data Analytics for doing above computation(more than 15 orders per 15 seconds). 3) Second stream in Data Analytics is created that actually notes such floods for past 1 minute and then send only messages to 2nd Data stream if the trend is noted continuously 1 min. This step is purely added to reduce number of SNS messages received in case of spike. 4) Second data stream is used to receive such alarm records and trigger lambda. 5) Lambda triggers SNS notification which in turn delivers an SMS message. It saves the copy of all the error messages in Aurora MySQL for aggregated view in future .
